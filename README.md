🪙 Gold Price Prediction 🪙

📰 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting gold prices based on historical data and relevant features. By accurately forecasting gold prices, this model can assist investors and traders in making informed decisions.

🗂️ Data
The project utilizes a dataset containing historical gold price data along with other potential influencing factors such as:

Date: The specific date of the observation.

SPX: S&P 500 Index
GLD: SPDR Gold Shares
USO: United States Oil Fund
SLV: iShares Silver Trust
EUR/USD: Euro/US Dollar Exchange Rate

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale.

Feature Engineering:

Create new features or transformations that might improve model performance.
Consider technical indicators or economic indicators that could be relevant to gold price prediction.

Model Selection:

Experiment with various machine learning algorithms suitable for time series forecasting, such as:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regression 
Evaluate the performance of different models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared).

📊 Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected model on the training set.   
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using the chosen metrics.   

Prediction:

Use the trained model to compare actual price with prediction price through the model.
